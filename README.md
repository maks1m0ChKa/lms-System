Hello everyone, guys, this is my first Huge project in java using such libraries as: jpa repository, lombok, spring security, themlife, postgreSql.
This is my own LMS system (learning platform). Like crm but not crm . I tried to write the project with the correct architecture itself and clean code using spring annotations.
